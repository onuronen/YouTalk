# YouTalk

It has never been this easy to talk to a YouTube video!

When I re-watch a podcast or a lecture video in Youtube, I usually remember the exact words, or a sentence
told by the person in the video and want to jump to that exact point. However, I end up spending a lot of time to find that specific time, and mostly can't.
Even if the video has content sections, searching for a specific sentence in a 10 minute interval is still very annoying!

YouTalk enhances the quality of user-video interaction and allows you to find the excerpt you are looking for within seconds!
